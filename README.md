# vstsndtone
vst in c++ to create a tone from a freq

To compile the program, you'll need to set up your development environment and configure the necessary build tools. Here's a general outline of the steps you can follow to compile the program:

1. Install the necessary tools: Ensure that you have a C++ compiler, such as GCC or Clang, installed on your system.

2. Set up the VST SDK: Download the VST SDK from the official Steinberg website (https://www.steinberg.net/sdk_downloads/vst3_sdk.html) and extract it to a directory on your system. Make a note of the path to the VST SDK directory as you'll need it for the next steps.

3. Create a new C++ project: Set up a new C++ project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor. Create a new source file with the C++ code provided earlier, and save it with a `.cpp` file extension.

4. Configure the build system: Depending on your development environment, you'll need to configure the build system to compile the VST plugin. For example, if you're using GCC, you can create a `Makefile` that specifies the necessary compilation and linking options. Make sure to include the VST SDK headers in the compilation process and link against the VST SDK libraries.

5. Build the project: Use the appropriate build command or build task in your IDE to compile the project. Alternatively, if you're using a `Makefile`, you can run the `make` command in the terminal to build the project.

6. Verify the build: After a successful build, you should have an output file (e.g., a shared library with a `.dll` or `.so` extension) that represents your VST plugin.

Please note that the exact steps and commands can vary depending on your operating system, development environment, and build system. Consult the documentation and resources for your specific tools to get detailed instructions on how to compile C++ programs and VST plugins.

Assuming you have GCC installed, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you have the C++ source file (vst_plugin.cpp).

# Compile the code
g++ -o vst_plugin vst_plugin.cpp -I /path/to/vst_sdk -L /path/to/vst_sdk -lvstsdk -lm -lpthread

# Run the compiled program
./vst_plugin
